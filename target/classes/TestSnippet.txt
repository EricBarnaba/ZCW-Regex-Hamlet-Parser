Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO
HORATIO
Hail to your lordship, Hamlet!
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
